# Individual relative risks of disease

This function takes a sample of individuals and computes each
individual's relative risk for each disease according to their current
tobacco and alcohol consumption. There is an option to tailor this to
the alcohol only, tobacco only, or joint tobacco and alcohol contexts.

## Usage

``` r
RRFunc(
  data,
  substance = c("tob", "alc", "tobalc"),
  k_year = NULL,
  alc_diseases = tobalcepi::alc_disease_names,
  alc_mort_and_morb = c("ischaemic_heart_disease", "livercirrhosis",
    "haemorrhagic_stroke", "ischaemic_stroke"),
  alc_risk_lags = TRUE,
  alc_indiv_risk_trajectories_store = NULL,
  alc_protective = TRUE,
  alc_wholly_chronic_thresholds = c(2, 2),
  alc_wholly_acute_thresholds = c(3, 4),
  grams_ethanol_per_unit = 8,
  tob_diseases = tobalcepi::tob_disease_names,
  tob_include_risk_in_former_smokers = TRUE,
  tobalc_include_int = FALSE,
  tobalc_int_data = tobalcepi::tob_alc_risk_int,
  show_progress = FALSE,
  within_model = TRUE,
  country = c("England", "Scotland")[1],
  other_lag_function = "Cancers"
)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  Data table of individual characteristics - this function uses current
  smoking and drinking status/amount.

- substance:

  Whether to compute relative risks for just alcohol ("alc"), just
  tobacco ("tob") or joint risks for tobacco and alcohol ("tobalc").

- k_year:

  Integer giving the current year of the simulation. Defaults to NULL.

- alc_diseases:

  Character vector of alcohol related diseases.

- alc_mort_and_morb:

  Character vector of the names of the alcohol related diseases that
  have separate risk functions for mortality and morbidity.

- alc_risk_lags:

  Logical - should each individual's relative risks for alcohol be
  lagged according to their past individual life-course trajectory of
  relative risks. Defaults to FALSE. This should only be set to TRUE for
  a model run that simulates individual trajectories, and should be
  FALSE if this function is being used as part of the calculation of
  population attributable fractions.

- alc_indiv_risk_trajectories_store:

  Data table that stores each individual's life-course history of
  relative risks for alcohol related diseases. This can be NULL for the
  first year of the simulation, and if this is the case then the
  function will initialise and return this storage data table after the
  first year of the simulation.

- alc_protective:

  Logical - whether to include the protective effects of alcohol in the
  risk function. Defaults to TRUE. If TRUE, then the part of the risk
  function \< 1 is set to equal 1.

- alc_wholly_chronic_thresholds:

  Numeric vector - the thresholds in UK standard units of alcohol per
  day over which individuals begin to experience an elevated risk for
  chronic diseases that are wholly attributable to alcohol. Input in the
  order c(female, male). Defaults to the current UK healthy drinking
  threshold of 14 units/week for females and males, or 2 units/day.

- alc_wholly_acute_thresholds:

  Numeric vector - the thresholds in UK standard units of alcohol /day
  over which individuals begin to experience an elevated risk for acute
  diseases that are wholly attributable to alcohol. Input in the form
  c(female, male). Defaults to 3 units/day for females and 4 units/day
  for males.

- grams_ethanol_per_unit:

  Numeric value giving the conversion factor for the number of grams of
  pure ethanol in one UK standard unit of alcohol.

- tob_diseases:

  Character vector of tobacco related diseases.

- tob_include_risk_in_former_smokers:

  Logical - whether the residual risks of smoking in former smokers
  should be considered (defaults to TRUE).

- tobalc_include_int:

  Logical - in computing joint relative risks for tobacco and alcohol,
  should a (synergistic/multiplicative) interaction between exposure to
  tobacco and alcohol be included. Defaults to FALSE. If TRUE, then only
  interactive effects for oesophageal, pharynx, oral cavity and larynx
  cancers are considered.

- tobalc_int_data:

  Data table containing the disease-specific interactions between
  tobacco and alcohol.

- show_progress:

  Logical - Should the progress of the loop through diseases be shown.
  Defaults to FALSE.

- within_model:

  Logical - is the function being used within a STAPM simulation.
  Defaults to TRUE. This is used only to determine which version of the
  alcohol binge model function to use - there is a version that suits
  the STAPM model by using only the age, sex and IMD quintile variables
  that are tracked within the STAPM model simulation.

- country:

  Character string - "England" or "Scotland"

- other_lag_function:

  Character - the name of the lag function to use for tobacco related
  conditions that are not categorised as CVD, COPD, or Cancer. Options:
  c("Cancers", "CVD", "COPD", "immediate"). The default is "Cancers",
  which gives the most conservative (i.e. slowest) estimate of the rate
  of decline in the risk of disease after quitting smoking.

## Value

Two data tables are returned:

- "data_plus_rr" is a version of "data" with added columns that give
  each individual's relative risk for each disease.

- "new_alc_indiv_risk_trajectories_store" is a version of
  "alc_indiv_risk_trajectories_store" with the relative risks for the
  current year added to the store.

## Details

See below

## Alcohol risk

For alcohol, the relative risk for each individual for each disease is
calculated based on their average weekly alcohol consumption (using
\[tobalcepi::RRalc()\]). Alcohol consumption is converted to grams of
ethanol consumed on average in a day, and this is truncated at 150g/day.
We assume 8 grams of ethanol per UK standard unit of alcohol. For
diseases that have separate mortality and morbidity risk functions,
separate variables are created containing the relative risks for each
for the same disease. Unlike tobacco, there is no "former drinker" state
in our alcohol modelling, meaning that individuals are not recorded as
being former drinkers – instead their alcohol consumption just falls to
zero and their relative risk for disease changes accordingly.

## Alcohol lags

To account for the lagged effects of changes to the amount that
individuals drink on their current risk of disease, it is necessary to
add memory to our modelling, which we do in this function by storing
each individual's past trajectory of the relative risk that they were
assigned for each disease. Doing so adds extra computations and makes
the model run a bit slower. In each year of the simulation, the current
relative risk of an individual is adjusted to take account of each
individual's stored drinking histories. This adjustment takes the form
of a weighted average of current and past relative risk, where the
weights are proportional to the disease-specific lag function (which
comes from
[`AlcLags`](https://stapm-platform.github.io/tobalcepi/reference/AlcLags.md)).
This method is slightly different to the method that was developed for
SAPM, as it needed to be adapted to suit the modelling of individual
life-course trajectories of alcohol consumption.

## Tobacco risk

For tobacco, the relative risk for each individual is calculated based
on whether they are a current, former or never smoker (using
[`RRtob`](https://stapm-platform.github.io/tobalcepi/reference/RRtob.md)).
Currently, all current smokers have the same relative risk regardless of
the amount they currently smoke or have smoked in the past (but we are
in the process of developing inputs and a function to take account of
dose-response effects of the amount currently smoked using
[`RRTobDR`](https://stapm-platform.github.io/tobalcepi/reference/RRTobDR.md)).

## Tobacco lags

Former smokers are initially given the relative risk associated with
current smokers (using
[`RRtob`](https://stapm-platform.github.io/tobalcepi/reference/RRtob.md)),
which we then scale according to a disease-specific function that
describes how risk declines after quitting smoking (which comes from
[`TobLags`](https://stapm-platform.github.io/tobalcepi/reference/TobLags.md)).
After 40 years from quitting, we assume that risk has reached the level
of a never smoker.

## Joint alcohol and tobacco risk

If both tobacco and alcohol are being considered in a joint model, we
combine the relative risks for current drinkers and smokers. In
implementing this combination of risks, we have built-in the option to
take account of synergistic effects (i.e. when the combined risk from
tobacco and alcohol consumption is more that would be expected from the
additive combination of risks, because for some conditions that tobacco
and alcohol consumption interact physiologically, and that interaction
further increases disease risk). We currently include estimates of
synergistic effects for oral, pharyngeal, laryngeal and oesophageal
cancers. We apply these effects using
[`TobAlcInt`](https://stapm-platform.github.io/tobalcepi/reference/TobAlcInt.md)
by scaling the joint risks by a 'synergy index', which takes the result
of a meta-analysis of the additional risk faced by people because they
consume both tobacco and alcohol.
