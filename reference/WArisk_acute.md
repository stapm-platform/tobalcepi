# Risk of acute conditions wholly-attributable to alcohol

Uses the 'new' binge model methods to calculate the risk that each
individual experiences each acute consequence of drinking during one
year (e.g. alcohol poisoning or the effects of acute intoxication).

## Usage

``` r
WArisk_acute(
  interval_prob_vec,
  SODFreq,
  sex,
  grams_ethanol_per_unit = 8,
  alc_wholly_acute_thresholds = c(3, 4)
)
```

## Arguments

- interval_prob_vec:

  Column of vectors - the probabilities that each individual drinks each
  amount of grams of ethanol (1:600) on a single drinking occasion.

- SODFreq:

  Numeric - the expected number of drinking occasions that each
  individual has each week.

- sex:

  Character - individual sex (Male or Female).

- grams_ethanol_per_unit:

  Numeric value giving the conversion factor for the number of grams of
  pure ethanol in one UK standard unit of alcohol.

- alc_wholly_acute_thresholds:

  Numeric vector - the thresholds in UK standard units of alcohol /day
  over which individuals begin to experience an elevated risk for acute
  diseases that are wholly attributable to alcohol. Input in the form
  c(female, male). Defaults to 3 units/day for females and 4 units/day
  for males.

## Value

Returns a numeric vector of each individual's relative risk of the acute
consequences of drinking.

## Details

The function implements a new method for estimating risk that was
developed to suit the STAPM modelling. The calculation is based on the
link between average weekly alcohol consumption and the distribution of
characteristics of single occasion drinking described by the parameter
estimates of Hill-McManus et al 2014.

The function uses the outputs of \[tobalcepi::AlcBinge_stapm()\] to
estimate for each individual: (1) the average amount that each
individual is expected to drink on a single drinking occasion; (2) the
standard deviation of the amount that each individual is expected to
drink on a single drinking occasion; (3) the expected number of drinking
occasions that each individual has each week.

Based on those estimates, a probability distribution is generated over
the number of units of alcohol that could be consumed on a single
drinking occasion by each individual. Values for the number of units
that fall below the binge drinking thresholds (6 units a day for women,
8 units a day for men) are set to zero. The probability distribution is
then used to compute the total number of units above the binge
thresholds that each individual is expected to drink in a year. We
assume that each individual's risk is proportional to that value.

## Examples

``` r

if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{

# example needs updating

# Function called within RRAlc()

data[ , ar := 
tobalcepi::WArisk_acute(
  SODMean = mean_sod[z],
  SODSDV = occ_sd[z],
  SODFreq = drink_freq[z],
  sex = sex[z],
  grams_ethanol_per_unit = grams_ethanol_per_unit,
  alc_wholly_acute_thresholds = alc_wholly_acute_thresholds
)]

risk_indiv <- 1 + data[ , ar] # add 1 to remove 0/0 = Not a number error later

data[ , ar := NULL]

} # }
