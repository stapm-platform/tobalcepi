# Calculate Population Attributable Fractions

Uses \[tobalcepi::RRFunc()\] and \[tobalcepi::subgroupRisk()\] to
calculate population attributable fractions based on the survey data
provided.

## Usage

``` r
PAFcalc(
  data = NULL,
  rrdata = NULL,
  substance,
  tob_include_risk_in_former_smokers = TRUE,
  alc_protective = TRUE,
  alc_wholly_chronic_thresholds = c(2, 2),
  alc_wholly_acute_thresholds = c(3, 4),
  grams_ethanol_per_unit = 8,
  use_weights = FALSE,
  year_range = "all",
  pool = FALSE,
  subgroups = c("sex", "age_cat"),
  tobalc_include_int = FALSE,
  within_model = FALSE,
  mort_or_morb = c("mort", "morb")[1],
  country = c("England", "Scotland")[1],
  other_lag_function = "Cancers",
  oesoph_subtypes = FALSE
)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  Data table of individual characteristics. Defaults to NULL.

- rrdata:

  Optional - data table containing individual tobacco and alcohol
  consumption characteristics with relative risks of disease already
  assigned. This could be useful for increasing efficiency - saving
  computer processing time. Defaults to NULL.

- substance:

  Whether to compute relative risks for just alcohol ("alc"), just
  tobacco ("tob") or joint risks for tobacco and alcohol ("tobalc").

- tob_include_risk_in_former_smokers:

  Logical - whether the residual risks of smoking in former smokers
  should be considered (defaults to TRUE).

- alc_protective:

  Logical - whether to include the protective effects of alcohol in the
  risk function. Defaults to TRUE. If TRUE, then the part of the risk
  function \< 1 is set to equal 1.

- alc_wholly_chronic_thresholds:

  Numeric vector - the thresholds in UK standard units of alcohol per
  day over which individuals begin to experience an elevated risk for
  chronic diseases that are wholly attributable to alcohol. Input in the
  order c(female, male). Defaults to the current UK healthy drinking
  threshold of 14 units/week for females and males, or 2 units/day.

- alc_wholly_acute_thresholds:

  Numeric vector - the thresholds in UK standard units of alcohol /day
  over which individuals begin to experience an elevated risk for acute
  diseases that are wholly attributable to alcohol. Input in the form
  c(female, male). Defaults to 3 units/day for females and 4 units/day
  for males.

- grams_ethanol_per_unit:

  Numeric value giving the conversion factor for the number of grams of
  pure ethanol in one UK standard unit of alcohol.

- use_weights:

  Logical - should the calculation account for survey weights. Defaults
  to FALSE. Weight variable must be called "wt_int".

- year_range:

  Either an integer vector of the years to be selected or "all".
  Defaults to "all".

- pool:

  Logical - should the years selected be pooled. Defaults to FALSE.

- subgroups:

  Character vector - the variable names of the subgroups used to
  stratify the estimates.

- tobalc_include_int:

  Logical - in computing joint relative risks for tobacco and alcohol,
  should a (synergistic/multiplicative) interaction between exposure to
  tobacco and alcohol be included. Defaults to FALSE. If TRUE, then only
  interactive effects for oesophageal, pharynx, oral cavity and larynx
  cancers are considered.

- within_model:

  Logical - is the function being used to calculate PAFs from the
  results of a STAPM model simulation. Defaults to FALSE.

- mort_or_morb:

  Character string - whether the risk functions for conditions with
  separate mortality and morbidity risk functions should refer to
  mortality or morbidity. Values could be "mort" or "morb". Default is
  "mort".

- country:

  Character string - "England" or "Scotland"

- other_lag_function:

  Character - the name of the lag function to use for tobacco related
  conditions that are not categorised as CVD, COPD, or Cancer. Options:
  c("Cancers", "CVD", "COPD", "immediate"). The default is "Cancers",
  which gives the most conservative (i.e. slowest) estimate of the rate
  of decline in the risk of disease after quitting smoking.

- oesoph_subtypes:

  Logical - should the attributable fractions for oesophageal cancer be
  multiplied by the proportions of each subtype. Defaults to FALSE.

## Value

Returns a data.table containing the estimated PAFs.

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{

tobacco_pafs <- PAFcalc(
 data = test_data,
 substance = "tob",
 tob_include_risk_in_former_smokers = TRUE,
 use_weights = TRUE,
 year_range = "all",
 pool = TRUE,
 subgroups = c("sex", "age_cat", "imd_quintile")
)

} # }
```
