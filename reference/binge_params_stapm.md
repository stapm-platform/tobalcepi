# Parameters to estimate amount drunk on single occasions - England - STAPM version

As our starting point we use the parameter estimates from Hill-McManus
et al 2014 - stored within the \`tobalcepi\` package as the data object
\`binge_params\`. The problem with using these parameters directly in
STAPM is that STAPM does not model the individual life-course
trajectories of some of the covariates investigated by Hill-McManus et
al, e.g. income, kids or social status. To get these parameters into a
form that can be used in STAPM, we matched them to the individual
covariates in a sample of Health Survey for England data from 2011-2017,
and then averaged the parameter values by age category, sex and IMD
quintiles. The code that does this is in the \`data-raw/binge_params\`
folder of the \`tobalcepi\` package. Individual height and weight is
needed for the calculation of time spent intoxicated, so this is also
averaged by age category, sex and IMD quintile.

## Usage

``` r
binge_params_stapm
```

## Format

A list of four data tables (1 = Negative binomial regression model for
the number of weekly drinking occasions, 2 = Fitted Heckman selection
model for probability that an individual drinks on at least 3 separate
occasions during the diary period, 3 = Fitted Heckman outcome regression
results for the standard deviation in the quantity of alcohol consumed
in a drinking occasion, 4 = average height and weight)
