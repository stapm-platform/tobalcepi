# Relative risks for alcohol related diseases

Computes the relative risks for each alcohol related disease based on
the published risk curves.

## Usage

``` r
RRalc(
  data,
  disease = "Pharynx",
  av_weekly_grams_per_day_var = "GPerDay",
  sex_var = "sex",
  age_var = "age",
  mort_or_morb = c("mort", "morb"),
  alc_protective = TRUE,
  alc_wholly_chronic_thresholds = c(2, 2),
  alc_wholly_acute_thresholds = c(3, 4),
  grams_ethanol_per_unit = 8,
  getcurve = FALSE,
  within_model = TRUE
)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  Data table of individual characteristics.

- disease:

  Character - the name of the disease for which the relative risks will
  be computed.

- av_weekly_grams_per_day_var:

  Character - the name of the variable containing each individual's
  average weekly consumption of alcohol in grams of ethanol per day.

- sex_var:

  Character - the name of the variable containing individual sex.

- age_var:

  Character - the name of the variable containing individual age in
  single years.

- mort_or_morb:

  Character - for alcohol related diseases that have separate relative
  risk curves for mortality and morbidity, should the curve
  corresponding to mortality ("mort") or morbidity ("morb") be used.

- alc_protective:

  Logical - whether to include the protective effects of alcohol in the
  risk function. Defaults to TRUE. If TRUE, then the part of the risk
  function \< 1 is set to equal 1.

- alc_wholly_chronic_thresholds:

  Numeric vector - the thresholds in UK standard units of alcohol per
  day over which individuals begin to experience an elevated risk for
  chronic diseases that are wholly attributable to alcohol. Input in the
  order c(female, male). Defaults to the current UK healthy drinking
  threshold of 14 units/week for females and males, or 2 units/day.

- alc_wholly_acute_thresholds:

  Numeric vector - the thresholds in UK standard units of alcohol /day
  over which individuals begin to experience an elevated risk for acute
  diseases that are wholly attributable to alcohol. Input in the form
  c(female, male). Defaults to 3 units/day for females and 4 units/day
  for males.

- grams_ethanol_per_unit:

  Numeric value giving the conversion factor for the number of grams of
  pure ethanol in one UK standard unit of alcohol.

- getcurve:

  Logical - do you just want to look at the risk function curve?

- within_model:

  Logical - is the function being used within a new-style STAPM
  simulation. Defaults to TRUE.

## Value

Returns a numeric vector of each individual's relative risks for the
alcohol related disease specified by "disease".

## Details

Relative risks for partially attributable chronic come from published
risk functions whose parameters have been hard-coded within this
function rather than being read from an external spreadsheet. For some
conditions there are separate risk functions for morbidity and
mortality. For conditions that show a J-shaped risk function that
indicates protective effects of alcohol, there is an option to remove
the protective effect by setting all RR \< 1 = 1.

Relative risks for partially attributable acute are computed by the
\[tobalcepi::PArisk()\] function called from within this function. The
characteristics of individual single occasion drinking are also
calculated within this function using \[tobalcepi::AlcBinge_stapm()\].

Relative risks for wholly attributable chronic and wholly attributable
acute conditions are calculated based on the extent to which either
weekly or daily consumption exceeds a pre-specified threshold. The risk
for wholly attributable acute conditions is calculated by the function
\[tobalcepi::WArisk_acute()\]. We developed a new method to model the
absolute risk of wholly attributable acute conditions to suit the STAPM
modelling. This new method is based on the method used to model the risk
of partially attributable acute conditions - the shape of the risk
function is determined by the individual variation in the total annual
number of units that are drunk above the male/female thresholds for
single occasion binge drinking.

## Examples

``` r

if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{

# Draw disease specific risk functions

# Example data
data <- data.table(
  GPerDay = 0:100,
  #peakday_grams = 0:100,
  sex = "Female",
  age = 30
)

# Apply the function
test1 <- RRalc(
  data,
  disease = "Pharynx",
  mort_or_morb = "mort"
)

test2 <- RRalc(
  data,
  disease = "Ischaemic_heart_disease",
  mort_or_morb = "morb"
)

test3 <- RRalc(
  data,
  disease = "LiverCirrhosis",
  mort_or_morb = "mort"
)

# Plot the risk functions
plot(test1 ~ I(0:100), type = "l", ylim = c(0, 10), ylab = "rr", 
main = "Females, age 30", xlab = "g per day")
