per day is consumed on a single drinking occasion.

## Usage

``` r
intervalprob(
  grams_ethanol = 1:540,
  SODMean = NULL,
  SODSDV = NULL,
  SODFreq = NULL,
  grams_ethanol_per_unit = 8
)
```

## Arguments

- grams_ethanol:

  Integer vector - the potential grams of ethanol drunk on a single
  occasion.

- SODMean:

  Numeric vector - the average amount that each individual is expected
  to drink on a single drinking occasion.

- SODSDV:

  Numeric vector - the standard deviation of the amount that each
  individual is expected to drink on a single drinking occasion.

- SODFreq:

  Numeric vector - the expected number of drinking occasions that each
