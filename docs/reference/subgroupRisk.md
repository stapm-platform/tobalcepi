# Summarise relative risk

Calculate the average relative risk across individuals in a subgroup, or
calculate the subgroup specific attributable fraction based on the
current relative risks.

## Usage

``` r
subgroupRisk(
  data,
  label = NULL,
  disease_names = c("Pharynx", "Oral_cavity"),
  af = FALSE,
  use_weights = FALSE,
  year_range = "all",
  pool = FALSE,
  subgroups = c("sex", "age_cat"),
  mort_or_morb = "mort",
  alc_mort_and_morb = c("Ischaemic_heart_disease", "LiverCirrhosis",
    "Haemorrhagic_Stroke", "Ischaemic_Stroke"),
  substance = c("alc", "tob", "tobalc")[3],
  smooth = FALSE,
  oesoph_subtypes = FALSE
)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  A data table of individual characteristics.

- label:

  Character - a label to append to the outcome variable to help identify
  it in later calculations.

- disease_names:

  Character vector - the names of the diseases for which summaries of
  relative risk are required.

- af:

  Logical - if TRUE, then attributable fractions are calculated. If
  FALSE, then the total relative risk is calculated. Defaults to FALSE.

- use_weights:

  Logical - should the calculation account for survey weights. Defaults
  to FALSE. Weight variable must be called "wt_int".

- year_range:

  Either an integer vector of the years to be selected or "all".
  Defaults to "all".

- pool:

  Logical - should the years selected be pooled. Defaults to FALSE.

- subgroups:

  Character vector - the variable names of the subgroups used to
  stratify the estimates.

- mort_or_morb:

  Character - for alcohol related diseases that have separate relative
  risk curves for mortality and morbidity, should the risks
  corresponding to mortality ("mort") or morbidity ("morb") be used.

- alc_mort_and_morb:

  Character vector of the names of the alcohol related diseases that
  have separate risk functions for mortality and morbidity.

- substance:

  Whether to compute relative risks for just alcohol ("alc"), just
  tobacco ("tob") or joint risks for tobacco and alcohol ("tobalc").

- smooth:

  Logical - should the age patterns in average risk be smoothed with a
  moving average. For use only if average risk is stratified by single
  years of age. Defaults to FALSE

- oesoph_subtypes:

  Logical - should the attributable fractions for oesophageal cancer be
  multiplied by the proportions of each subtype. Defaults to FALSE.

## Value

Returns a data table containing the subgroup specific summaries for each
disease.

## Details

Attributable fractions are calculated using the method as in Bellis &
Jones 2014, which is also equivalent to the method described in the
Brennan et al. 2015 SAPM mathematical description paper.

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
# Simulate individual data

# Using the parameters for the Gamma distribution from Kehoe et al. 2012
n <- 1e4
grams_ethanol_day <- rgamma(n, shape = 0.69, scale = 19.03)

data <- data.table(
  year = 2016,
  weekmean = grams_ethanol_day * 7 / 8,
  peakday = 2 * grams_ethanol_day / 8,
  age = rpois(n, 30),
  sex = sample(x = c("Male", "Female"), size = n, replace = T),
  income5cat = "1_lowest income",
  imd_quintile = "5_most_deprived",
  kids = "0",
  social_grade = "C2DE",
  eduend4cat = "16-18", # age finished education
  ethnic2cat = "white", # white / non-white
  employ2cat = "yes", # employed / not
  wtval = rnorm(n, mean = 60, sd = 5), # weight in kg
  htval = rnorm(n, mean = 1.7, sd = .1) # height in m
)

# Disease names
alc_disease_names <- c(
  "Pharynx",
  "Ischaemic_heart_disease",
  "LiverCirrhosis",
  "Transport_injuries",
  "Alcohol_poisoning",
  "Alcoholic_gastritis"
)

# Run basic function without alcohol lags
test_data <- RRFunc(
  data = copy(data),
  substance = "alc",
  alc_diseases = alc_disease_names,
  alc_wholly_chronic_thresholds = c(2, 2),
  alc_wholly_acute_thresholds = c(3, 3),
  show_progress = TRUE
)

# Calculate alcohol attributable fractions
test_aafs <- subgroupRisk(
  data = test_data$data_plus_rr,
  disease_names = alc_disease_names,
  af = TRUE,
  subgroups = "sex"
)

test_aafs
} # }
