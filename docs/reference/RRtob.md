# Tobacco relative risks

Relative risks for current vs. never cigarette smokers.

## Usage

``` r
RRtob(
  data,
  disease = "Pharynx",
  smoker_status_var = "smk.state",
  sex_var = "sex",
  age_var = "age",
  rr_data = tobalcepi::tobacco_relative_risks
)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  Data table of individual characteristics.

- disease:

  Character - the name of the disease for which the relative risks will
  be computed.

- smoker_status_var:

  Character - the name of the variable containing whether an individual
  is a current, former or never smoker.

- sex_var:

  Character - the name of the variable containing individual sex.

- age_var:

  Character - the name of the variable containing individual age in
  single years.

- rr_data:

  Data table containing the relative risks of current vs. never smokers.
  The data table "tobacco_relative_risks" is embedded within the stapmr
  package.

## Value

Returns a numeric vector of each individual's relative risks for the
tobacco-related disease specified by "disease".

## Details

We focus on the risks of current smoking and limit ourselves to diseases
that affect the consumer themselves e.g. excluding secondary effects of
smoking on children. We assume the equivalence of relative risks and
odds ratios. Our starting point was the Royal College of Physician's
(RCP) report "Hiding in plain sight: Treating tobacco dependency in the
NHS", which reviewed smoking-disease associations to produce an updated
list of diseases that are caused by smoking and updated risk sources. We
mainly keep to the RCP report's disease list and risk functions, with
any deviations from the RCP list and risk sources being for one of two
reasons:

- There are often slightly conflicting ICD-10 code definitions used for
  some diseases and we have sought to harmonise these consistently
  across both tobacco and alcohol, based on the Sheffield Alcohol Policy
  Model (SAPM) v4.0 disease list;

- Since publication of the RCP report, Cancer Research UK (CRUK)
  produced their own disease list and risk sources for cancers
  attributable to modifiable risk factors, including tobacco and
  alcohol. Discussions with CRUK shaped the disease definitions in our
  updated Sheffield disease list for alcohol. Where there are
  differences in the risk sources used in the RCP report and CRUK's
  work, we take the estimate that matches most closely to our disease
  definitions, or the more recent estimate.

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
# Example data

n <- 1e2

data <- data.table(
  smk.state = sample(x = c("current", "former", "never"), size = n, replace = T),
  sex = "Female",
  age = 30
)

# Apply the function
test <- RRtob(
  data,
  disease = "Pharynx"
)
} # }
```
