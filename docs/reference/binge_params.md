# Parameters to estimate amount drunk on single occasions

We use parameter estimates from Hill-McManus et al 2014 -

## Usage

``` r
binge_params
```

## Format

A list of three data tables (1 = Table 3, 2 = Table 5, 3 = Table 6)

## Source

Hill-McManus et al 2014. "Estimation of usual occasion-based individual
drinking patterns using diary survey data".

## Details

Table 3 - Negative binomial regression model for the number of weekly
drinking occasions

Table 5 - Fitted Heckman selection model for probability that an
individual drinks on at least 3 separate occasions during the diary
period

Table 6 - Fitted Heckman outcome regression results for the standard
deviation in the quantity of alcohol consumed in a drinking occasion

We do not use parameter estimates from Table 4 - Fitted Tobit regression
model for the mean grams of alcohol consumed during a drinking occasion.
This is because we calculate from the data by dividing the weekly mean
alcohol consumption by the estimated number of weekly drinking
occasions.
